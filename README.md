# DatingAppFeature
In this repository you will find the whole progress in making a feature for a datingapp. In the beginning we were ask to make jobstories and choose one to make in to a feature. This feature makes it so the user can apply filters on the people they want to come across in the dating app. Later in this project we are going to collaborate to add other functions and make a complete functioning dating app. You can find my progress in my [wiki](https://github.com/annaboomsma/datingAppFeature/wiki)

## Jobstory
_When I'm on a dating app, I want to be able to filter the people who appear in my suggestions, so I can find the one._

## Luvely
Luvely is a dating app where you can filter the people in our system. You can filter on gender and sexuality.
